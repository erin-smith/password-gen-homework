HW #3: Create a dynamic random password generator that takes user input into account

This is a random password generator that populates a password based on prompts answered by the user.  It can contain 8-128 characters, alpha-numeric with capitals and special characters.  This is my first project using more advanced Javascript elements such as: JSON, objects, functions, "for loop", concatination, arrays, forEach, operators, "if else statements",  Math.Random, Math.floor, click events and more.

The generator should validate user inputs, act mobiliy responsive, and render password in text box when prompts are satisfied.
