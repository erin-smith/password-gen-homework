HW #3: Create a dynamic random password generator that takes user input into account

This is a random password generator that populates a password based on prompts answered by the user.  It can contain 8-128 characters, alpha-numeric with capitals and special characters.  This is my first project using more advanced Javascript elements such as: JSON, objects, functions, "for loop", sets, dot.chain elements, manipulating arrays, "forEach", operators, "if/else statements",  Math.Random, Math.floor, "click events" or Event listeners, and more.

The generator should validate user inputs, act screen-responsive, and render password in text-box with proper attributes when prompts are satisfied.
